- QUESTION 2 -
1. "!=" means not equals and can be used in conditional 'if' statements 
2. Would mean 'not' that object
3. If '!' comes after something like a method it is part of the methods name and so doesn't have a set meaning. It usually means it is a mutating method though.
4. '?' is a operator that acts like if...else
5. Same as question 3. If '?' is after a method name it is just part of the methods name. In this case it probably doesn't mutate but that's not guaranteed.
6. '!!' gives the equivalent boolean value of the object it is placed before.
